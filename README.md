FizzBuzz Program


### FizzBuzz Program
Description
The classic FizzBuzz programming challenge! This program prints numbers from 1 to a specified limit (100 in my code), but with a twist:

**Fizz** - printed for numbers divisible by 3

**Buzz** - printed for numbers divisible by 5

**FizzBuzz** - printed for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5
