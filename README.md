# Summer Projects Collection

Welcome to my 2025 summer programming projects! This repository contains a collection of small but interesting coding challenges and exercises I've worked on during my summer break. Each project demonstrates different programming concepts and problem-solving approaches.

## FizzBuzz Program
Description
The classic FizzBuzz programming challenge! This program prints numbers from 1 to a specified limit (100 in my code), but with a twist:

**Fizz** - printed for numbers divisible by 3

**Buzz** - printed for numbers divisible by 5

**FizzBuzz** - printed for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5

## Scrabble Board Game Program
This is a simple Python program with an interactive artifact that finds all valid Scrabble words that can be formed from a given set of letters. It first generates all possible permutations of the input letters and checks them against a local scrabble dictionary file to produce an alphabetized list of valid words in the Scrabble game. 

In my program, I uses "tabind" as the given combinations of words if one does not provide any word. Of course, you can modify the my_letters variable inside the Python script or type different words on the program to the set of letters you want to check.
This is what the interactive artifact looks like:
